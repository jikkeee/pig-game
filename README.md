# dicegame

This game was built while learning Javascript.

Less focus was given to style, and more on getting the game to work, for best experience view this game on desktop or desktop mode if you use mobile. I'd like to know what you think about the project. find me on Twitter @jaekralj

If you'd like to help make the game responsive please fork this repo away
